# How to contribute

### Issues

Please be as specific as possible when describing an issue. Providing the following details will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:
* Any sample code **SHOULD BE** included in [code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks)
* **.yo-rc.json** - A copy of your `.yo-rc.json` is highly appreciated.
* **Generator Version** - is it a regression?
* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown, a non-minified stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only IE8?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) or
  [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)) or an unambiguous set of steps.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

### Pull requests

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

**Style Guide**
Please brief yourself on [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5) style guide with two space indent.

**Documentation**
If possible add documentation for every new feature or directory structure change. Feel free to commit corrections or better docs!

**Branch**
Must be one of the following:

* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* docs: Documentation only changes
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* perf: A code change that improves performance
* test: Adding missing tests
* chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
